# Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard 

##  Project Overview
This project consists of two interactive dashboards designed in Power BI to analyze and visualize hospital and patient data. The dashboards focus on both clinical outcomes and patient adherence/satisfaction, providing valuable insights for healthcare administrators, clinicians, and policymakers.

## Dashboards
1. Hospital Admission & Clinical Outcomes Dashboard
Purpose: Provides a snapshot of hospital admissions, length of stay, diagnosis trends, and discharge destinations.
Key Insights:
- Total patients admitted: 10,000+
- Average length of stay: 16 days
- Most common diagnoses: Injuries, respiratory problems, cardiac issues
- Diagnosis with longest hospital stay
- Discharge destinations (Home, Nursing Facility, Rehabilitation Center)

2. Patient Adherence & Satisfaction Dashboard
Purpose: Focuses on patient behavior post-discharge, including medication adherence, follow-up appointments, and care satisfaction.
Key Insights:
- Age group 51â€“70 had the highest adherence to medication and follow-up
- Discharge location significantly impacts adherence rates
- Care satisfaction levels by diagnosis are fairly balanced
- Gender and age distribution trends among patients

## Tools & Technologies
Power BI â€“ dashboard development and visualization
Excel â€“ data source

##  Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning  
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats in the dataset.  
   - Standardized columns for accurate analysis.  

2. Dashboard Development  
   - Designed visuals for patient demographics, health indicators, and treatment distribution.  
   - Created slicers and filters for interactivity.  
   - Applied KPIs and DAX measures for advanced calculations.  

3. Insights Generation  
   - Identified patterns in healthcare usage.  
   - Highlighted correlations between patient demographics and treatment outcomes.  
   - Provided data-backed recommendations for improving patient care.  

##  Dashboard Highlights
- Patient Demographics â€“ Age, gender, and regional distribution.  
- Health Indicators â€“ Trends in chronic conditions and preventive care.  
- Treatment Analysis â€“ Frequency and types of treatments administered.  
- KPI Metrics â€“ Re-admission rates, patient satisfaction, and cost analysis.  


##  Results
The dashboard allows healthcare professionals and decision-makers to:  
- Monitor patient care trends more effectively.  
- Identify high-risk groups requiring intervention.  
- Optimize healthcare resources and preventive measures.
